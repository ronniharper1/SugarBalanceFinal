          <h1>Why this matters.</h1>
          <p>
            I created SugarBalance because during my years of high-school, I would always experience feeling tired or low of energy.
            I would sleep my whole day away if I wanted to. As a student-athlete, I would eat 3 meals a day, maybe 4 and still felt
            low in energy. After sophomore year of college, I finally got blood work done and found out I had low blood sugar. I
            wasn't surprised because I knew their had to be something wrong with me. After realizing, I didn't know where to look.
            I was stuck looking on google and reading articles that were not helpful. I wanted to create a space where people like
            me can come and find resources and tips to help them manage their blood sugar. Especially as an athlete, I need meals to
            give me energy through the day as well. It was so hard trying to find well balanced meals that help me maintain my levels
            at a standard. I hope this website can help people like me who struggle with blood sugar and want to live a balanced life.

            <h1>What is Blood Sugar (Glucose)?</h1>
            <p>
              Blood sugar, or blood glucose, is the main sugar found in your blood and your body's main source of energy.
              It comes from the food you eat and is carried to your cells through your bloodstream. Your blood sugar levels can be
              affected by various factors including diet, physical activity, medications, and overall health conditions.

            <h1>What is Hypoglycemia?</h1>
            <p>
              A condition known as hypoglycemia occurs when blood sugar (glucose) levels fall too low, frequently as a result of
              excessive insulin use, missing meals, or vigorous exercise. Shaking, perspiration, disorientation, lightheadedness,
              and agitation are some of the symptoms. It may result in seizures, unconsciousness, or even death if treatment is delayed.

            <h1>What is Hyperglycemia?</h1>
            <p>
              Blood sugar levels that rise above normal is called Hyperglycemia and they are frequently caused by insufficient insulin
              production or ineffective insulin utilization as in diabetes. Excessive thirst, frequent urination, fatigue, and blurred
              vision are typical symptoms. If treatment is not received, it may result in life-threatening diabetic keto acidosis or
              other severe complications, such as harm to the kidneys, nerves, or eyes.
